    <P>The corpse of 15-year-old student Samiksha, who was brutally murdered, is discovered. Arjan Sethi is an aspiring filmmaker who wants to make a movie on psychopaths. After multiple rejections from film producers and pressure from his family, he becomes a SI in the Himachal Pradesh Police, with the help of his brother-in-law Narinder Singh, a police officer himself. While Arjan does have a significant rank, he is treated like a rookie, due to lack of police experience. He moves in with his sister Seema, Narinder, and their daughter Payal. Payal gets into trouble in school and asks Arjan for help, so he meets her teacher Divya at school. He befriends Divya and her hearing and speech-impaired niece, Iti.</P>

    <h>Storyline</h>
    <p>Akshay's Arjan Sethi, a 36-year-old aspiring thriller filmmaker
         turn reluctant cop with Himachal Police, joins the force with his well-resea
         rched knowledge of psychopaths and serial killers. Just then, a potential serial killer, with absolutely no motive the cops can establish, rampantly abducting and killing teenage school girls, emerges in the quaint Kasauli. His seniors in the force, of course, do not entertain his insights. His brother-in-law, Narinder (Chandrachur Singh), has just one piece of advice - keep your head down and work, say yes, and don't try to be a 'hero'. A piece of advice that soon proves to be redundant, and not just because it is an A
        kshay Kumar film and he ought to emerge as the hero.</p>
